# Python-Challenge-3
Kyle Novak's Challenge 3 from Module 3

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to review my work on The Python Challenge! My instructor Mark Flynn wanted us to mention in our ReadMe's that we were given permission to us IPYNB format for this assignment.

Folders labeled Images and Starter_Code are the initial files that were provided for this assignment. This was to prove that I can commit changes from Python to GitHub without having to upload files from my computer to GitHub.

Folers marked PyBank and PyPoll will be what you will need to check on my findings.

PyBank folder contains an IPYNB of PyBank (labeled PyBank.ipynb) and a .csv text file (labeled Financial Analyis.csv) of the results that are found in the terminal of PyBank.ipynb. PyBank.ipynb features the coding I used along with some comments to clarify what the coding is finding, compiling, listing, etc.

PyPoll folder contains a folder called Resources. Please click on that to find files marked PyPoll.ipynb and Election_Results.csv. The file of PyPoll.ipynb features the coding I used along with some comments to clarify what the coding is finding, compiling, listing, etc. Election_Results.csv is a text file showing the Election Results that are found in the terminal of PyPoll.ipynb.

As always, please reach out should you have any questions.

Cheers,
- Kyle Novak
